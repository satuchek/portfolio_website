						allow the ghost to possess bodies as well as the way the gravestones interact with the world. You can view the trailer on Youtube or see our

						computer science topics. We introduce them to robotics, web development, as well as programming in Python. At the end of each
						semester, the girls build a project to help the community. You can see news about us by clicking on the icon below!</p>

						draggable onto the play area from the UI. I was also responsible for making the background parallax. You can check out our trailer by
